@Fig:context-diagram show the context.

## Thesis Structure {#intro-structure}

The thesis structure is summarised here. Chapter -@Sec:lit-review gives a summary of the background literature, we need to use just the number as `pandoc-crossref` does not ref it quite right. But for sub-chapter references like @sec:lit-review-one you can use the standard link. Chapter -@sec:method summaries the method used in this PhD research. Chapter -@sec:evaluation covers the evaluation of the method, with some funky tables in @sec:evaluation-method. Finally, Chapter -@sec:discussion discusses the outcomes of this research with future work discussed in @sec:future-work.
